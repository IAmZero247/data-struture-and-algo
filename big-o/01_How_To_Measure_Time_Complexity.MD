# General Thumb Rules

| Rulez      | Description  | Complexity
| -----------| ------------ |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Rule1     | Any assignment statements , or if statement is executed once regardless of the size of problem  |O(1)
| Rule2     | A simple for loop (with no internal loop and skips)                                             | o(N)
| Rule3     | A nexted lop of same type takes quadratic time complexity                                       | O(N^2)
| Rule4     | A loop in which the controlling parameter is divided by 2 at each stage                         | O(Log N)
| Rule5     | When dealing with multiple statements , just add them                                           |
