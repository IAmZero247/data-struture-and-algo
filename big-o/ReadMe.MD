# Big O 

  **A metric we used to describe the efficiency of algorithms**
  
  **Time Complexity -> a way of showing how runtime increases as size of input increases**
  
  **Space Complexity -> a way of showing how the memory consumation increase as size of input increases**

  ## Big O , Big Omega , Big Theta
  
    - **Big O** - complexity less or equal to worst case.
    - **Big Omega** -  complexity that atleast more then the best case 
    - **Big Theta** - complexity within the bound between best and worst case
    
    
    
  ## Examples
  
| Complexity | Recursion    | Examples
| -----------| ------------ |-----------------------------------------
| O(1)       | Contstant    |  Accesing a specific element in array
| O(N)       | Linear       | Iterating whole element from a array
| O(LOGN)    | Logarithmic  | Find an element in sorted array
| O(N^2)     | Quadratic    | Looking at every index in a array twice
| O(2^N)     | Exponential  | Double recursion in fibonacci
