# Big O 

  **A metric we used to describe the efficiency of algorithms**
  
  **Time Complexity -> a way of showing how runtime increases as size of input increases**
  
  **Space Complexity -> a way of showing how the memory consumation increase as size of input increases**

  ## Big O , Big Omega , Big Theta
  
    - **Big O** - complexity less or equal to worst case.
    - **Big Omega** -  complexity that atleast more then the best case 
    - **Big Theta** - complexity within the bound between best and worst case
